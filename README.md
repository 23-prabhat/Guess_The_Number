## 💡 About The Project

**Guess The Number** is a fun little arcade-style web game built with **React, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS**. The game challenges you to guess a **randomly generated number between 1–100**. After each guess, you’ll get hints like *Too High* or *Too Low* until you nail the correct number!

Styled with a **cyberpunk neon theme** and anime/gaming vibes, this isn’t just about guessing numbers — it’s about looking cool while doing it. 🚀
